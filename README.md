## About the Video Course
R is an open source language for data analysis and graphics. It is platform-independent and allows users to load various packages and develop their own to interpret data better. This video is packed with practical recipes, designed to provide you with all the guidance needed to get to grips with data visualization with R.
We start off with the basics of R plots and an introduction to heat maps and customizing them. After this, we gradually take you through creating interactive maps using the googleVis package. Finally, we generate chloropleth maps and contouring maps, bubble plots, and pie charts.
